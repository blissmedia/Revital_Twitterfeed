Magento-Twitter-API-v1.1-Feed-
==============================

Use the new Twitter PHP Oauth API v1.1 to display realtime latest tweets in your magento cart.

I have included the 2 Oauth files from the Abraham PHP API inside this magento extension setup so there is no linking required.

Please fork and add caching possibilities, I could not get that too work. 

There is also a possiblity to add parameters to magento widgets/extensions in this case but I did not need that functionality for this install.

Hopefully going to add that in future releases.
